Three Observable Trends- 
1. The less drivers available in a area, the higher the average fare. This can be seen in rural areas where fares are high while amount of drivers are low as well as urban areas where fares are lower but amount of drivers are higher. 
2. Rural drivers are the most advantagous as they are 1% of the total drivers but they drive 5.2% of all rides and bring in 6.6% of all fares. 
3. Pyber's business model could be in jeopardy if certain cities decide to ban ride sharing as the majority of revenue comes from urban areas.
